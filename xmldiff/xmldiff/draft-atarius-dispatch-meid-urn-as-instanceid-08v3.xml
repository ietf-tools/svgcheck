			<t>
				Mobile communication has been rapidly
				improved from low-bit-rate circuit-switched systems to the higher-data-rate packet-switched system. The
				packet-switched system has added
				the mobile capability of Internet Protocol
				(IP) connectivity; thereby, the IP
				Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) have made
				SIP-based calls and IP multimedia
				sessions from mobile devices possible.
			</t>

			<t>
				3GPP2 defines High Rate Packet Data (HRPD) with high data rates, and it dispenses with the 
				1x Circuit Switched (1xCS) infrastructure.
				This means that with HRPD networks, voice calls will need to be conducted using IP and IMS. 
				However,
				the transition to all IP, SIP-based IMS networks worldwide will take a great 
				many years from the time of this writing and mobile devices
				will need to operate in both IP/SIP/IMS mode and circuit-switched mode.

<!--[rfced] This sentence is difficult to parse.  Please clarify the
use of "the transition to all IP".  If the proposed text does not
capture your intent, please let us know how to update.

Original:
However, the transition to all IP, SIP
   based IMS networks worldwide will take a great many years from the
   time of this writing and mobile devices will need to operate in both
   IP/SIP/IMS mode and circuit switched mode.

Perhaps:
However, SIP-based IMS networks will take a great many years from the time of writing to transition to the use of all IP; mobile devices will need to operate in both IP/SIP/IMS mode and circuit-switched mode.

-->


				This 
				means that calls and sessions
				will need to be handed over between IP/SIP/IMS mode and circuit-switched mode 
				mid-call or mid-session. 
				To achieve this, the mobile
				device needs to simultaneously communicate via both the IP/SIP/IMS domain and 
				the circuit-switched domain.
			</t>

			<t>
				To meet this need, 3GPP2 has specified how to maintain voice-session continuity 
				between the IP/SIP/IMS domain and the 
				circuit switched domain in 3GPP2 S.X0042-B <xref target="refs.S.X0042-B"/>.
			</t>


<!--[rfced] This sentence is long and a bit convoluted.  Please rephrase (and consider breaking into smaller sentences).

Original:
   In order for the mobile device to access SIP/IMS voice service via
   the circuit switched domain 3GPP2 has specified that Mobile Switching
   Center (MSC) server either via IMS Media Gateway Control Function
   (MGCF) or directly, if enhanced by SIP interface, controls mobile
   voice call setup over the circuit switched radio access while
   establishing the corresponding voice session in the core network
   using SIP/IMS.

			<t> 
				In order for the mobile device to
				access SIP/IMS voice service via the
				circuit-switched domain, 3GPP2 has
				specified that the Mobile Switching Center
				(MSC) server either via IMS Media
				Gateway Control Function (MGCF) or
				directly, if enhanced by SIP
				interface, controls mobile voice call
				setup over the circuit switched radio
				access while establishing the
				corresponding voice session in the
				core network using SIP/IMS. To enable
				this, the mobile device MUST be
				identified in both the 1xCS and IP/SIP/IMS
				domains. The only mobile device
				identifier that is transportable using
				1xCS signaling is the MEID; therefore,
				the Instance ID included by the MGCF
				or the MSC server and the Instance ID
				directly included by the mobile device
				both need to be based on the MEID.
			</t>

			<t>
				Additionally in order to meet the
				above requirements, the same MEID that
				is obtained from the circuit-switched
				signaling by the MSC server needs to
				be obtainable from SIP signaling so
				that it can be determined that both
				the SIP signaling and circuit-switched
				signaling originate from the same
				mobile device.

		<section title="3GPP2 Use Cases">

			<t><list style="numbers">
				<t>The mobile device includes its MEID
				in the SIP REGISTER request so that
				the SIP registrar can perform a check
				of the Equipment Identity Register
				(EIR) to verify if this mobile device
				is allowed or barred from accessing
				the network for non-emergency services
				(e.g., because it has been stolen). If
				the mobile device is not allowed to
				access the network for non-emergency
				services, the SIP registrar can reject
				the registration. Thus, a barred mobile
				device is prevented from accessing the
				network for non-emergency services.
			</t>


			<t>
				The mobile device includes its MEID
				in SIP INVITE requests used to
				establish emergency sessions.  This is
				so that the Public Safety Answering
				Point (PSAP) can obtain the MEID of
				the mobile device for identification
				purposes if required by regulations.
			</t>

			
			<t>
				The inclusion by the mobile device
				of its MEID in SIP INVITE requests
				used to establish emergency sessions
				is also used in the cases of
				unauthenticated emergency sessions to
				enable the network to identify the
				mobile device.  This is especially
				important if the unauthenticated
				emergency session is handed over from
				the packet-switched domain to the
				circuit-switched domain. In this
				scenario, the MEID is the only
				identifier that is common to both
				domains. The Emergency Access Transfer
				Function (EATF), which coordinates the
				call transfer between the domains, can
				thus use the MEID to identify that the
				circuit-switched call is from the same
				mobile device that was in the
				emergency session in the packet-switched domain.

				A UAC MUST NOT use the 3GPP2 MEID URN

			   The same concerns apply when
