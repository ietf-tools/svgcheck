xmldiff (0.5.0) distribution(s); urgency=low

	* Many different css changes applied.  Changes include: resize
	the different columns, add background coloration, wrap lines and
	make the tree leafs of variable height, change the charset to allow
	Utf-8 characters.  Long term should point to the column change code,
	but currently I don't know of a good place.
	* Format paragraphs as a single node in the tree rather than spreading
	them out over the tree structure.  This improves readablity substantially.
	* Force the matching of some v2 and v3 elements which provide equivalent
	functionality, but have different names.
	* Include comments as nodes in the displayed tree.
	* Fix some errors in the tree merging code so that elements are placed in
	the correct location.
	* Need to separate the left/right class taging from the li element as it
	gets clobbered by the tree code.  Thus the addition of span elements all
	over the place.
	* Clean up some memory leaks in the distance algorithm.
