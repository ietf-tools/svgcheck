        When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of object identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for use by that working group.
        This document describes the range of identifiers that were assigned in that donated range, transfers control of that range to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that range.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of object identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for use by that working group.
        These object identifiers are primarily used with Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) <xref target="ASN.1"/>.
        The ASN.1 specifications continue to evolve, but object identifiers can be used with any and all versions of ASN.1.
      </t>

      
      <t>
        The Curdle object identifier range is:
      </t>
      
        <figure>
<artwork>        
  { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 100 }
  to
  { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 127 }
</artwork>
        </figure>

      <t>
        This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in that donated range, transfers control of the range to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that range.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
        IANA is asked to create one new registry table.
      </t>

      <section title='"SMI Security for Curdle" Registry'>
        <t>
          Within the SMI-numbers registry, add an "SMI Security for Curdle" table with the three columns:

          <ttcol>Decimal</ttcol><ttcol>Description</ttcol><ttcol>References</ttcol>

        </texttable>

        <t>
          The column 'Decimal' is required to be a number between 100 and 127 inclusive.
        </t>

        <t>
          Future updates to this table require both 'Specification Required' and 'Expert Review' as defiened in <xref target="RFC5226"/>.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        This document populates an IANA registry, and it raises no new security considerations.
        The protocols that specify these values include the security considerations associated with their usage.
