rfctools-common (0.5.3) distribution(s); urgency=low

	* Copy the cache code in for URLs on .dtd and .ent files, this allows for
	  a DTD to be grabbed from the network
	* Switch to using resolve_string in those cases where we have cached the file
	  so that futher includes have the correct path when getting resolved.

rfctools-common (0.5.2) distribution(s); urgency=low

	* Distribute the old rfc 2629 dtd and ent files so that v2 files parse correctly
	* Correct processing so that we can play games with where to search file files.
	  If the file does not exist and the source directory is given then strip the
	  path so that we will search in different directories for the file.

rfctools-common (0.5.0) distribution(s); urgency=urgency

	* Setup log routines so that UTF-8 strings can be written on
	  all consoles.  This is a problem as Python v2 thinks consoles
	  are written assumed to be ASCII and for Windows it is the code
	  page of the console.  Pipes have a third method of making this decision
	* Swap the order of two attributes to match the order in the
	  xmlrfc v2 to v3 upgrade program.
